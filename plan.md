# Renewable Energy Analysis Platform - Project Plan

## Overview
Multi-page Reflex app for solar PV potential analysis using PVGIS API, with shapefile upload, interactive mapping, background analysis, and comprehensive results visualization.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Upload Page ✅
**Goal**: Set up project structure, global state management, navigation, and complete Upload page functionality

- [x] Install dependencies (geopandas, shapely, pyproj for GIS operations)
- [x] Create global AppState with session persistence for uploaded data, analysis results, and selection
- [x] Implement multi-page navigation (Upload, Explore, Analysis, Results, Admin)
- [x] Build Upload page UI with drag-and-drop zone, validation feedback
- [x] Implement shapefile processing: unzip, read, validate, reproject to EPSG:4326, convert to GeoJSON
- [x] Display dataset summary cards (feature_count, CRS, bounding box)
- [x] Show attribute schema table and paginated sample rows
- [x] Add toast notifications for success/error feedback
- [x] Test upload workflow with event handlers

---

## Phase 2: Explore Page with Interactive Map ✅
**Goal**: Interactive map with building layer visualization, selection sync with attribute table, and layer toggle

- [x] Create Explore page layout with map (top) and attribute table (bottom)
- [x] Render buildings GeoJSON layer on map with OpenStreetMap base tiles
- [x] Implement map-to-table selection sync (click feature → highlight row)
- [x] Implement table-to-map selection sync (click row → zoom and highlight)
- [x] Add layer toggle controls (Buildings, PV Potential layers)
- [x] Build attribute table with pagination, sorting, and filter box
- [x] Display KPI cards (total buildings, selected building info, extent)
- [x] Add PV results layer with choropleth styling and legend (conditional on results existence)
- [x] Test map interactions and selection synchronization

---

## Phase 3: Analysis Page with PVGIS Integration ✅
**Goal**: Background PVGIS analysis orchestration with real-time progress updates and caching

- [x] Create pvgis_analyzer.py module (stub with mock data if API unavailable)
- [x] Build Analysis page UI with mode selector (All buildings / Single building)
- [x] Add parameter controls (tilt, azimuth, PV kWp, losses with defaults)
- [x] Implement background task for PVGIS analysis with progress streaming
- [x] Create progress UI with overall progress bar and per-building status list
- [x] Implement cache system with deterministic keys (building_id + params + version)
- [x] Store results with pv_potential_kwh, pv_kwp, yield_kwh_per_kwp, confidence, monthly series
- [x] Add Stop/Cancel functionality for running analysis
- [x] Handle PVGIS errors with retry logic (max 3 attempts with backoff)
- [x] Test background analysis workflow and progress updates

## Phase 4: Results Page with Charts & Export
**Goal**: Comprehensive results visualization with KPIs, interactive charts, and data export

- [ ] Create Results page layout with KPI cards row
- [ ] Display summary KPIs (total annual production MWh, avg specific yield, buildings analyzed)
- [ ] Build monthly production bar chart (aggregated across all buildings)
- [ ] Create specific yield scatter/box chart by building
- [ ] Implement building selection detail panel with monthly series and parameters
- [ ] Add chart interactivity (hover tooltips, click to select building)
- [ ] Build export functionality (CSV/JSON download of results)
- [ ] Add "Back to Map" navigation button to view spatial patterns
- [ ] Test charts update on selection changes

---

## Phase 5: Admin Page & Polish
**Goal**: Cache management, diagnostics, accessibility improvements, and final polish

- [ ] Create Admin page with cache entry list (building_id, params, timestamp, size)
- [ ] Add cache invalidation controls (selected/all) with confirmation modal
- [ ] Display recent log entries and data directory usage
- [ ] Implement high-contrast theme toggle option
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for map and charts
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation across all pages
- [ ] Add ARIA labels and focus indicators to all interactive controls
- [ ] Add tooltips and help text for all parameters and controls
- [ ] Create README with workflow explanation and page descriptions
- [ ] Final testing and screenshot verification of all pages

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Features & Optimization
**Goal**: Performance optimizations, error handling refinements, and advanced UX features

- [ ] Implement geometry simplification for large datasets (auto-detect and apply)
- [ ] Add bbox-driven display for extremely heavy polygon datasets
- [ ] Optimize attribute table rendering with virtual scrolling
- [ ] Enhance error messages with actionable guidance (missing .prj, .shp, .dbf files)
- [ ] Add geometry fix attempts for invalid polygons (buffer(0) technique)
- [ ] Implement resume functionality for interrupted analysis jobs
- [ ] Add algorithm version config for cache key stability
- [ ] Configure max concurrent PVGIS calls with environment variable
- [ ] Add roof efficiency and shading factor post-processing parameters
- [ ] Final comprehensive testing across all workflows
